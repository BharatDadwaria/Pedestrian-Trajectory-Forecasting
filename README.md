# Pedestrian-Trajectory-Forecasting

This is my Final Year M.Tech Research thesis. The main motivation behind this project is the wide variety of application in the field of Autonomous vehicles, Autonomous mobile robot and survillance system. 

## Introduction
Pedestrian Trajectory Forecasting is the predicting the trajectories of the pedestrian based on their past bahaviour and motion information. Predicitng the trajectories of the pedestrian is very complex task as human motion is vary hard to model and their behviour is very compicative and depends on various moods and external factors. Since the task of predicting the trajectory was very complex so that's why we divided the whole pipeline into five submodules.
