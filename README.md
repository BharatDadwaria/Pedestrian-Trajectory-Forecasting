# Pedestrian-Trajectory-Forecasting

This is my Final Year M.Tech Research thesis. The main motivation behind this project is the wide variety of application in the field of Autonomous vehicles, Autonomous mobile robot and survillance system. 

## Introduction
Pedestrian Trajectory Forecasting is the predicting the trajectories of the pedestrian based on their past bahaviour and motion information. Predicitng the trajectories of the pedestrian is very complex task as human motion is vary hard to model and their behviour is very compicative and depends on various moods and external factors. Since the task of predicting the trajectory was very complex so that's why we divided the whole pipeline into five submodules.

## Code
Available soon

## Results
Based on our proposed pipeline we were able to predict the next 10 frames trajectories of each of the pedestrian in the frame. The Green Trajectory is the ground truth trajectory and the Red Trajectories are the predicted trajectory through our proposed model.
